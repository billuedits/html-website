<h2>1. Demon slayer</h2>
<p>Damn this is a goated series that I binged for god damn 5 times.<br />
Crazy it sounds right ? but the storyline is too good to miss.<br />
For sure don't forget to check on Tokito ahhahaha...</p>
<h2>2. You</h2>
<p>A puurfect psyco series. Here you will get romance, comedy, stalking skill, sexual content and all the funn.<br />
You seriously can't miss this one. This is gonna change your way of thinking.<br />
Either you like it to the core or else I consider you as a boring person. bleehhhh!!!</p>
<h2>3. Game of Thrones</h2>
<p>This is something that will shape you in the character you want to see yourself in.<br />
Each and every character got a good role, the conspiracy behind every person makes you doubt your desicion. There is no such thing as karma in this story.<br />
Only the strong and wise survive. GOOD LUCK!!!</p>
